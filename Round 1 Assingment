Round 1 Assingment:

Question: Write a query to find the countries with the highest temperatures in the dataset.
SELECT COUNTRY, MAX(TEMPERATURE) AS HIGHEST_TEMPERATURE
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION
GROUP BY COUNTRY
ORDER BY MAX(TEMPERATURE) DESC;

Question: Write a query to identify the countries with the lowest CO2 emissions in the dataset.
SELECT TOP (1) COUNTRY, MIN(CO2_EMISSION) AS LOWEST_CO2_EMISSION
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION
GROUP BY COUNTRY
ORDER BY MIN(CO2_EMISSION) ASC;

Question: Write a query to find all temperature records above a specific value, for example, 20 degrees Celsius.
SELECT TEMPERATURE 
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION 
WHERE TEMPERATURE > 20;

Question: Write a query to list all countries with CO2 emissions data available for the year 2020.
SELECT COUNTRY
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION 
WHERE YEAR = '2020';

Question: Write a query to count the total number of temperature records in the dataset.
SELECT COUNT(TEMPERATURE) AS TOTAL_COUNT 
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION;

Question: Write a query to identify any countries with missing temperature data for a specific year, for example, 2015.
SELECT COUNTRY 
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION 
WHERE YEAR = '2015' AND TEMPERATURE IS NULL;

Question: Write a query to find the average temperature for each year in the dataset.
SELECT YEAR, AVG(TEMPERATURE) AS AVERAGE_TEMPERATURE 
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION 
GROUP BY YEAR;

Question: Write a query to calculate the total CO2 emissions for all countries in the dataset.
SELECT COUNTRY,
SUM(CO2_EMISSION) AS TOTAL_EMISSION
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION
GROUP BY COUNTRY;

Question: Write a query to sort the temperature data in descending order based on the temperature values.
SELECT TEMPERATURE 
FROM COUNTRY_POLLUTION 
ORDER BY TEMPERATURE DESC;
